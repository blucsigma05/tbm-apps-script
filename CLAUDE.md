# TBM (TillerBudgetMaster) — Project Rules

## Identity
Google Apps Script + HtmlService system for household finance, kid chore management, and education dashboards. Google Sheets is the data layer, Tiller Money syncs bank data, HTML dashboards served via GAS web app, Cloudflare proxy at thompsonfams.com.

- **SSID:** `1_jn-I4IfsqgnVOFiS38SVVzNJ0MAJtu2645iU5k0U9c`
- **Deployment ID:** Run `clasp deployments` to find it. Always use `clasp deploy -i <ID>`. Never create new.

## Architecture

**Data flow (one direction only):**
Tiller → Google Sheets → DataEngine.gs → Safe wrappers → HTML dashboards via `google.script.run`

**Core rules:**
- Zero client-side financial calculations. All dashboards display-only. ONE exception: ThePulse `simulate()` for debt slider.
- TAB_MAP lives in DataEngine.gs. All sheet references go through it. Never hardcode sheet names with emoji prefixes.
- KH_ tabs live inside the main TBM workbook (NOT a separate spreadsheet). RING_QUEST_SSID is dead.
- All `.gs` files share one global scope. Constants and TAB_MAP from DataEngine.gs are available everywhere. Never redeclare.

**Financial data visibility:**
- TheSoul (kitchen) + KidsHub (kid tablets) → NO financial data. Kids can see these.
- TheSpine (office) → Financial data, display-only.
- ThePulse + TheVein → Full financial data, interactive.

## Session Start

**Mandatory first command for any Sonnet build thread (run before anything else):**
```
cd "C:/Dev/tbm-apps-script"
```
This loads `.claude/settings.local.json` (repo-scoped MCP + Bash allowances). Without it, every MCP tool call prompts for approval scoped to the wrong directory (`C:\Program Files\Git`). Any "don't ask again" approval saved from the wrong directory is wasted — it won't apply here. Use the hardcoded path rather than `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` — that command fails when the shell starts outside any git worktree. See #420 + #391 for the full Sonnet environment context.

1. Read this file fully
2. Run `clasp deployments` to confirm deployment ID
3. Fetch PM Active Versions (Notion `2c8cea3cd9e8818eaf53df73cb5c2eee`) for current state
4. Check the TBM Operations Project board and the "Needs Decision" column for anything blocked on LT input
5. Check `gh issue list -l claude:inbox --state open` for pending Codex findings auto-filed by `codex-review-filer.yml`. If any exist, they are the priority queue — address before starting new work.
6. Do NOT begin work until steps 1–5 are complete

---

## Verify-Before-Assert (THE Cardinal Rule)

> "I had the data, I just didn't look." Before writing assertions, check the actual file. Confidence without verification is a hallucination.

- Before writing code that references a payload field → grep the source for the exact field name. 0 matches = doesn't exist. If matches found, read surrounding 5 lines for shape.
- Before writing any assertion → run the function from the editor FIRST, read Logger output, write assertions against what you saw.
- Before declaring any build item complete → grep for the function name in pushed code. 0 matches = wasn't built. Run the function and read Logger output.
- Subagent summaries are leads, not facts. Verify field names, object shapes, and signatures against the actual construction site (`var result = {}` or `return {}` block).
- **The test:** "Can I point to grep output or Logger output proving this?" If no → stop and verify. If yes → proceed.

### Output self-review (MANDATORY)
After every file modification, re-read the changed region. Verify: (1) edit applied correctly, (2) no side effects in surrounding code, (3) versions updated. "Done" = verified correct, not "write operation completed."

### Context decay
After 10+ messages in a session, re-read any file before editing it. Do not trust memory of file contents from earlier in the conversation.

## Workflow — Issues, PRs, and the Project Board

**The hierarchy:** Epic → Issue → PR. Every Issue has exactly one reason to exist. Every PR closes at least one Issue via `Closes #NNN`. Chat is transient. If it needs to survive the conversation, it becomes an Issue.

**Object types — pick one when creating work:**

| Type | Use when | GitHub form | Primary label |
|------|----------|-------------|---------------|
| Spec | A design decision that needs alignment before code | Issue + `specs/*.md` file | `kind:spec` |
| Bug | Something is broken | Issue | `kind:bug` |
| Task | Actionable work that isn't a spec or bug | Issue | `kind:task` |
| Decision | A question requiring LT input | Issue | `kind:decision` + `needs:lt-decision` |
| Epic | Long-running initiative spanning multiple issues | Issue | `kind:epic` |
| Code change | Anything that modifies files | PR | inherits from the Issue it closes |

**The rule that kills "where are we":** if an Issue/PR exists on the Project board, its status tells you where it is. Do not ask for status in chat — check the board. If the board is wrong, fix the labels.

**Label families (six):**

- `kind:` spec, bug, task, decision, epic — what the work IS
- `severity:` blocker, critical, major, minor — how urgent (existing Codex label scheme)
- `model:` opus, sonnet, codex, lt — who is working on it
- `needs:` lt-decision, implementation, review, qa, spec — what's blocking progress
- `area:` jj, buggsy, finance, infra, qa, education, shared — which part of the system
- `status:` draft, approved, implementing, shipped — spec lifecycle (specs only)

**Standard flow for any change:**

1. Open an Issue with labels `kind:*`, `severity:*`, `area:*`, and `model:*` (or `needs:lt-decision` if blocked on LT). Card lands in Backlog.
2. If it needs a spec first: open a `kind:spec` Issue first, spec PR lands, spec Issue closes with `status:approved`, implementation Issue opens linking to the approved spec.
3. Implementation: open a branch, push code, open PR with `Closes #NNN` in the description. Card moves to In Progress.
4. CI + Codex review. Card moves to In Review.
5. PR merges. Issue auto-closes. Card moves to Done. Pushover notification fires.

**Specs specifically:**
- Spec text lives as `specs/<name>.md` in the repo (permanent reference)
- The spec PR merges into main so the file is canonical
- Decisions from spec review are recorded as PR comments before merge AND in the spec file under "Open questions — resolved"
- A separate implementation Issue opens after the spec PR merges, linking to the spec file path
- Implementation PRs close the implementation Issue, not the spec Issue

**Decisions specifically:**
- Never let an open question live as a bullet in chat. If LT needs to answer it, it is an Issue with `kind:decision` + `needs:lt-decision`.
- LT's answer is the comment that closes the Issue.
- If a decision is blocking 3 specs, the Issue has back-links in all 3 specs.

**Codex findings:**
- In-PR review comments stay in the PR (that's the evidence).
- **Automated path (bot):** For blocker/critical findings in the `<!-- codex-review-report -->` JSON emitted by `codex-pr-review.yml`, the **inline filer step inside that same workflow** runs `file_codex_review_findings.py` immediately after posting the review comment. It auto-files a durable Issue labeled `claude:inbox` + `kind:bug` + `severity:*` + `model:sonnet` (default) + `area:*` + `type:*`, with body including a `## Build Skills` section and the exact `#issuecomment-<id>` URL. (Inline rather than a separate workflow with an `issue_comment` trigger because `GITHUB_TOKEN`-authored events don't trigger other workflow runs — GitHub's recursive-loop prevention. See #456.) Dedup is signature-based on `rule + file + evidence_hash + pr_number` — re-reviews on the same PR dedup to the same Issue signature: open matches no-op, recent closed matches (≤7 days) reopen, no duplicate is created. Kill switches: `AUTOMATION_ENABLED`, `CODEX_REVIEW_FILER_ENABLED`, `CLAUDE_INBOX_MAJOR_ENABLED`. `model:codex` is used instead of `model:sonnet` when the finding is in review-pipeline code itself.
- **Manual path (human):** Codex (or LT, during a manual audit via "audit N" in ChatGPT) posts freeform PR comments with `Codex finding: FIX/HOLD/BLOCK` markers. `codex-finding-listener.yml` picks these up via `parse_finding_comment.py` under the `{blucsigma05, chatgpt-codex-connector}` author whitelist and auto-files durable Issues for `severity:blocker` via `_finding_dedup.py` (comment-ID dedup). This path is unchanged.
- Both paths produce durable Issues; they differ in trust domain and dedup mechanism. Do not merge them.

**When LT says "PR" but means "Issue" (or vice versa):**
- Claude MUST redirect and confirm: "You said PR — did you mean the Issue, or is this actually a code change?"
- Do not silently create the wrong object.
- One sentence, no back-and-forth. If ambiguous after one confirmation, default to Issue.

**Build Skills (MANDATORY on every Issue):**

Every Issue body or first comment MUST include a `## Build Skills` section listing the skill names needed. This tells any agent picking up the work which skills to load. Format:

```
## Build Skills
- `skill-name` — why it's needed (one line)
```

Common skills: `thompson-engineer` (GAS architecture), `game-design` (game UI), `adhd-accommodations` (Buggsy surfaces), `grading-review-pipeline` (submission→review→award), `data-contracts` (sheet schemas), `deploy-pipeline` (full build pipeline), `education-qa` (education testing), `qa-walkthrough` (device QA), `route-contracts` (CF routing), `incident-response` (diagnosing failures), `parent-reporting` (parent dashboard UX), `curriculum-planner` (TEKS/scope).

**Forbidden patterns:**
- Answering "where are we on X?" with a chat summary. Correct: "Check Issue #NNN" or "Check the Project board."
- Opening a PR without a linked Issue (exception: trivial one-line fixes).
- Handing Sonnet a prompt via chat copy-paste instead of an Issue body.
- Letting a decision live in PR comments when it should be an Issue.
- Using `needs:lt-decision` on a PR — those belong on Issues, then the PR picks up the decided answer.
- Filing an Issue without a `## Build Skills` section.

---

## Two-Lane Roles (MANDATORY)

- **Builder lane** (Claude/Opus/Sonnet): scope, spec, implement, fix.
- **Audit lane** (Codex): inspects the named PR or named current state only.
- **PR-scoped audits**: when LT names a PR, audit that PR alone unless LT explicitly says `stacked` or `after PR M`.
- **Plain-English commands**: agents translate LT's natural-language instructions into repo state. LT does not own git terminology.
- **Boardroom conversations become operating memos** in `ops/operating-memos/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>.md` when they change how TBM operates.
- **Handoff comments are optional**: use `<!-- tbm-handoff -->` only when a PR changes hands mid-flight or pauses with a clear next action. At most one active comment per PR, edited in place.

See `ops/WORKFLOW.md § Two-Lane Handoff Rules` for the command contract, trigger phrases, and full examples.

---

## Never Do This

### Tier 1 — Causes Regressions
1. Hardcoding sheet names instead of TAB_MAP
2. Using ES6 in any `.html` file (see ES5 Enforcement section)
3. Writing code against assumed field names without grep verification
4. Replacing an HTML file without grepping the CURRENT file for all interactive elements (buttons, forms, modals, onclick handlers) and verifying every one exists in the new file
5. Reading DataEngine.gs or any large file in a single read
6. Claiming "done" without re-reading the modified file to verify
7. Skipping smoke test before deploy
8. Adding a `google.script.run` call without a matching `withFailureHandler()` (also: must add Safe wrapper to smoke test wiring check)

### Tier 2 — Causes Deploy Problems
9. Stopping at `clasp push` without completing the full pipeline
10. Creating a new GAS deployment instead of updating existing
11. Version mismatches across the 3 required locations (header, getter, EOF)
12. Pushing to GAS without `git commit` + `git push` after
13. Pushing without running `audit-source.sh` first
14. Using `clasp deploy` without `-i` flag
15. Pushing a branch that is behind `origin/main` (staleness gate catches this)
16. Embedding Python/bash heredocs in workflow YAML instead of using `.github/scripts/`

### Tier 3 — Causes Drift
17. Duplicating constants across files (shared global scope — they're already available)
18. Writing to a sheet tab owned by another module
19. Skipping Notion deploy page update after deploy
20. Guessing at versions — read the actual file header
21. Starting a big refactor without a Step 0 cleanup commit
22. Trusting a grep that returned suspiciously few results without re-running narrower
23. Running multiple PRs that touch hot files (workflows, CLAUDE.md, audit-source.sh) in parallel

> Code-style anti-patterns (`tryLock` vs `waitLock`, `getActiveSpreadsheet` vs `openById`, double-emoji Notion bug) are in **Pattern Registry** below. Do not duplicate them here.

---

## Deploy Freeze

A deploy freeze halts all 19 freeze-critical mutation paths during risky windows. Full contract: `ops/deploy-freeze.md`.

**Set freeze BEFORE:** schema migrations, finance model changes, parent approval flow changes mid-Sunday, MER close, any PR touching ≥5 freeze-critical sites at once.

**Who can set/lift:** LT only (requires clasp run access).

**Activation:** `clasp run setFreeze_ "reason" "2026-04-17T10:00:00Z"` (or omit expiry for 24h auto-lift)

**Lift:** `clasp run liftFreeze_`

**Emergency bypass:** `clasp run generateEmergencyToken_ "reason" 60` — 1-hour token, per-mutation audit trail, `GATE_BREACH` Pushover on first use.

**audit-source.sh Check 6** blocks push when freeze is active. Override: `EMERGENCY=1 bash audit-source.sh` — commit message MUST start with `EMERGENCY: <reason>`.

**Code rule (work-doctrine rule 14 extension):** Any PR adding a new freeze-critical mutation site MUST add `assertNotFrozen_('freeze-critical', 'funcName')` to the Safe wrapper AND add a row to `ops/mutation-paths.md`.

---

## Deploy Pipeline (MANDATORY — every deploy)
Run steps 1–11 autonomously. Report results at end. LT's only action: review PR and approve.
**EXCEPTION: If any step returns unexpected output, STOP and report before continuing.**

1. **EDIT** → Make changes locally in `C:\Dev\tbm-apps-script`
2. **VERSION** → Bump version in ALL 3 locations per changed `.gs` file: line 3 header, `get*Version()` return, EOF comment. All three MUST match. Grep to verify.
3. **AUDIT** → `bash audit-source.sh` — FAIL = stop. WARN = review each, fix or document.
   Covers: branch staleness, ES5 compliance (in `.html`), version consistency (3-location), withFailureHandler wiring, route integrity, eval() usage, workflow YAML lint (if changed), Python script compile (if changed).
4. **PUSH** → `clasp push`
5. **PRE-QA** → Run `diagPreQA()` from GASHardening.gs. ALL categories must show PASS. Any FAIL = stop, fix, re-push, re-run.
6. **DEPLOY** → `clasp deploy -i <deploymentId>`
7. **VERIFY** → Hit `?action=runTests` on PRODUCTION `/exec` URL. Assert structured JSON: `overall == "PASS"` AND `smoke.overall == "PASS"`. Check ErrorLog for new errors (last 5 min). NOTE: `/dev` URLs require Google auth — curl/fetch cannot reach them.
8. **GIT** → Git Bash only (NOT PowerShell): `git checkout -b <branch>` → `git add <specific files>` → `git commit` → `git push origin <branch>` → Open PR with `Closes #NNN`
9. **NOTION** → Update PM Active Versions DB. Write thread handoff to Archive. Update deploy page title (version only, NOT icon).
10. **CF VERIFY** → curl all CF proxy endpoints from route list, expect 200.
11. **RELEASE** → `gh release create v<version> --notes "<summary>"`

**Never stop at step 4 (PUSH).**

### Deploy Proof
Deploy success is proven, not inferred:
- **Deploy success = HTTP 200 from `?action=runTests` AND structured JSON assertion of `overall == "PASS"` AND `smoke.overall == "PASS"`.** NOT just "workflow completed."
- **The deploy Pushover MUST include:** deployment ID, version, smoke result, commit SHA, timestamp.
- **If any proof field can't be captured,** the workflow fails and sends BLOCKED Pushover. Don't ship a deploy proof that can be silently truncated.

## QA Gates (7 Gates + 2 Audits)

Reference: Notion `336cea3cd9e881798061e9032cee48c3`

### Gate 1 — Wiring Check (automated)
Run by `audit-source.sh` (Deploy Pipeline step 3). Verifies every `withSuccessHandler` has a matching `withFailureHandler`, and that every `google.script.run.<fn>Safe()` call has a matching server function exported in `Code.gs`.

### Gate 2 — Pre-Push Compile (automated)
Run by `audit-source.sh`. Python script compile + workflow YAML lint when those files change. ES5 banned-pattern grep on `.html` files.

### Gate 3 — Version Consistency (automated)
Run by `audit-source.sh`. Verifies 3-location match (header, getter, EOF) in every changed `.gs` file.

### Gate 4 — Deploy Manifest
Every build spec produces a grep manifest WHEN THE SPEC IS CREATED — not after the build. Before declaring "QA ready," run every manifest line. Zero matches or `display:none` = NOT DONE.

Format:
```
# [Build Spec Name] — Deploy Manifest
grep -n "[unique identifier]" [file]    → expected: [what should be there]
```

### Gate 5 — Feature Verification Checklist

Every build spec must include BOTH a Deploy Manifest (Gate 4) AND a Feature Verification Checklist (Gate 5).
- Deploy Manifest answers: "Does this feature EXIST?"
- Feature Verification answers: "Is this feature CORRECT?"

**Rules:**
1. Checklist is created AT SPEC TIME by Chat. Code does NOT define its own checklist.
2. Each item has a specific, measurable pass condition — not "looks good" but "background is #2D1B69" or "avatar is 120px" or "streak shows consecutive days."
3. The checklist is CUMULATIVE. Prior verified items carry forward to every future build of that surface.
4. Before declaring "QA ready," verify every checklist item by grep or by running the function and reading output.
5. Items verified only by reading source don't count. Run it, read Logger output, confirm the value.

**What goes on the checklist:** specific hex colors, pixel dimensions, math/formula outputs, conditional logic, text content, state transitions, interaction behavior.

### Gate 6 — Pre-QA Diagnostic (automated)
Run `diagPreQA()` from `GASHardening.gs` (Deploy Pipeline step 5). All categories must show PASS. Any FAIL blocks deploy. Captures: TAB_MAP integrity, lock service health, workbook reference, cache state, Pushover key validity.

### Gate 7 — Post-Deploy Check
After deploy, verify production is stable — not just at deploy time but an hour later.

1. MonitorEngine log: zero errors since deploy timestamp
2. KidsHub heartbeat cache: age < 120 seconds
3. No Pushover error alerts fired since deploy
4. Hit each surface URL once, confirm no 500/error screen

For evening deploys, next-morning check is acceptable.

### Audit A — Code Quality Lab (periodic)
Runs architecture/security checks against the codebase. Triggered by scheduled task or by Codex review request.

### Audit B — Cross-Surface Consistency (periodic)
Skeleton parity check across HTML surfaces. Catches drift between sibling modules (e.g., HomeworkModule vs reading-module footer nav).

## QA Operator Mode

> **Documentation pending.** This section is flagged TODO from the 2026-04-13 claude-md-review.
> The relevant code: `QAOperatorSafe.gs`. Pattern: per-request QA SSID override, signed token contract, `/qa/*` route isolation.
> Before working in this area, read `QAOperatorSafe.gs` and the QA Test Plan Notion page (`32ccea3cd9e8818f9e30f317dea0fed7`).
> When you understand the contract, replace this stub with the actual documentation.

## ES5 Enforcement (ALL .html files)
Android WebView and Fully Kiosk Browser do NOT support ES6+.

| Banned | Use Instead |
|--------|------------|
| `let` / `const` | `var` |
| `=>` arrow functions | `function(){}` |
| Template literals `` ` `` | String concatenation |
| `async` / `await` | Callbacks or `.then()` |
| `??` nullish coalescing | `\|\|` or ternary |
| `?.` optional chaining | Explicit null checks |
| `.includes()` | `indexOf() !== -1` |
| `.find()` | `for` loop |
| `URLSearchParams` | Parse manually |
| `Object.entries()` / `.values()` | `Object.keys()` + loop |
| `...` spread | `Array.prototype.slice.call()` |
| Destructuring `{a, b} = obj` | `var a = obj.a` |
| `backdrop-filter` CSS | Not supported on Fire TV |

### ES5 Allowed Methods
These ES5.1 methods ARE allowed — they work in all target WebViews (Fully Kiosk 4.x+, Fire TV Silk, Samsung Internet 4+):
`Object.keys()`, `Array.isArray()`, `JSON.parse()`/`JSON.stringify()`, `indexOf()`, `forEach()`, `map()`, `filter()`, `trim()`

---

## API Proxy Contract
HTML modules served via Cloudflare use the `google.script.run` shim which POSTs to `/api?fn=FUNCTION_NAME`. When accessed directly via GAS (not Cloudflare), the XHR fallback uses `?action=api&fn=FUNCTION_NAME&args=[]` — both paths handled by `serveData()` router branch in `Code.gs`. Both paths resolve to the same function execution.

---

## Pattern Registry
| Pattern | Canonical location |
|---------|--------------------|
| Error logging | GASHardening.gs → `logError_()` |
| Perf monitoring | GASHardening.gs → `logPerf_()`, `withMonitor_()` |
| Tab name lookup | DataEngine.gs → `TAB_MAP` |
| Version reporting | GASHardening.gs → `getDeployedVersions()` |
| Cache read/write | Code.gs → `getCachedPayload_()`, `setCachedPayload_()` |
| Workbook reference | `openById(SSID)` — NEVER `getActiveSpreadsheet()` |
| Push notifications | AlertEngine.gs → `sendPush_()` (recipients: LT, JT, BOTH) — use `PUSHOVER_PRIORITY.*` constants, never bare integers |
| KH heartbeat | KidsHub.gs → `stampKHHeartbeat_()` after every write |
| Lock acquisition | `waitLock(30000)` — NEVER `tryLock()` |
| Smoke + regression | Code.gs → `?action=runTests` returns combined JSON |
| New `google.script.run` call | Must have `withFailureHandler()`. Must add Safe wrapper to smoke test check. Must run audit-source.sh. |
| Hygiene finding → Issue | `.github/scripts/file_hygiene_issue.py` via `.github/workflows/hygiene-filer.yml`. Emitter passes structured finding JSON; filer dedups by marker and files or reopens. |

---

## Hygiene Automation — Issue Filer (Phase 1)

Hygiene workflows (HYG-*) that detect findings can file dedup'd GitHub Issues via the shared filer at `.github/workflows/hygiene-filer.yml`. The filer identifies findings by a signature hidden in the Issue body — **never** by title (titles are human-editable):

```
<!-- auto-finding v=1 check=<check-id> sig=<16-hex> -->
```

The signature is `sha256` over a canonical `identity` dict (keys and string values stripped + lowercased, keys sorted) — **never** over volatile fields like `age_days` or byte counts. Identity captures the problem, not its current measurement.

**Dedup search order** (open → suppressed → recent closed → new):
1. Any OPEN Issue matches → no-op
2. Any CLOSED Issue with `auto:suppressed` label → no-op forever (LT rejected)
3. Any CLOSED Issue within 7 days without `auto:suppressed` → reopen
4. Otherwise → create new Issue with `auto:filed` label

**Kill switches** (all ≤60s): `vars.AUTOMATION_ENABLED=false` (master), `vars.HYGIENE_ISSUE_CREATION_ENABLED=false` (filer only), disable `hygiene-filer.yml` workflow in UI. Filer diagnostics post to the pinned filer-status Issue (`vars.STATUS_ISSUE_NUMBER`).

Phase 1 scope: one pilot check (HYG-06 version drift). Phase 2+ is out of scope — this system files Issues only, no auto-PRs.

## CI/CD Pipeline

### CI Checks (GitHub Actions — runs on every PR)
| Order | Check | Workflow | Purpose |
|-------|-------|----------|---------|
| 1 | Workflow Lint | `workflow-lint.yml` | actionlint + py_compile + shellcheck — runs first |
| 2 | TBM Smoke + Regression | `ci.yml` | GAS smoke + regression tests |
| 2 | Playwright Regression | `playwright-regression.yml` | E2E + viewport screenshots |
| 2 | Codex PR Review | `codex-pr-review.yml` | gpt-4o code review — has `needs: lint-gate`. Inlines the claude:inbox filer step after posting its review comment (#450 Phase 1 — runs `file_codex_review_findings.py`). |

LT applies branch protection in GitHub Settings > Branches > Branch protection rules (UI action).

**Auto-merge policy:** Currently **manual review required**. Auto-merge can be enabled when the pipeline runs cleanly on 5 consecutive PRs without false negatives. Status: not yet enabled.

### Autonomous Merge Authority

Distinct from "Auto-merge policy" above (which concerns GitHub's CI-triggered auto-merge feature). This section governs when Claude Code may run `gh pr merge` directly during an interactive session.

**Merge autonomously (green = go).** All of the following must hold:
- Both CI AND Codex have explicit PASS verdicts on the PR
- The PR matches one of these shapes:
  - `CHORE:` / `DOCS:` / `CONFIG:` non-sensitive prefixed changes
  - `severity:minor` feature work with no mutation-path changes
  - Review-fix commits on a PR LT already saw the diff of
  - Any PR where LT said "ship it" / "merge" / "let's go" in the same session
- The PR does NOT touch any file in the "always confirm" list below
- No active deploy freeze

**Always confirm merge first (non-negotiable, no override).**
- Hot files: `.github/workflows/**`, `.github/scripts/**`, `CLAUDE.md`, `audit-source.sh`, `cloudflare-worker.js`
- Freeze-critical paths (enumerated in `ops/mutation-paths.md`)
- Schema migrations or `TAB_MAP` changes
- Financial model changes (DataEngine calculators, debt cascade, close logic)
- Any PR with `severity:blocker` or `severity:critical`
- Any PR where CI is yellow/red or Codex verdict is FAIL / INCONCLUSIVE
- Kid-visible UI changes without a visual diff shown to LT in session
- During an active deploy freeze (any merge)
- PRs opened by a non-interactive agent lane (e.g. the nightly grinder — see #454)

**Gray zone (ask first time, remember the call).**
- First PR of a new pattern or area
- New scheduled tasks / cron triggers
- Changes to alert tier thresholds (`PUSHOVER_PRIORITY.*`)
- First PR after a CI workflow change

**Autonomous overnight work is a separate contract.** The nightly grinder (#454) and any future unsupervised automation **merges nothing**. That is a different trust tier — no interactive LT to catch subtle wrongness. Interactive session authority above does not extend to lanes LT is not watching.

**Evidence standard for "Claude says green."** Before an autonomous merge, Claude must have VERIFIED (not assumed):
- `gh pr checks <N>` shows all required checks passing (not just "workflow_run success")
- `gh pr view <N>` shows a Codex comment with explicit `**Verdict:** PASS` AND `**Files Reviewed:**` section
- `gh pr view <N>` shows no unresolved review threads from LT or other reviewers

"Looks green in the UI" is not evidence. Read the API response.

### Cloudflare Worker Deploy Verification (issue #403)

There are two separate Cloudflare integrations on this repo — do not confuse them:

| Integration | What it does | Authoritative? |
|-------------|--------------|----------------|
| `deploy-worker.yml` (TBM-owned GitHub Action) | Runs `wrangler deploy` on push to main — **this is what actually deploys the worker** | ✅ Yes |
| Cloudflare GitHub App "Workers Build" status | Posts a CI status badge to PRs — cosmetic signal only, does not gate anything | ❌ No |

**When a Cloudflare worker change is pushed, the correct verification sequence is:**

```bash
# Verify HTTP 200 and body — -f causes non-zero exit on 4xx/5xx
curl -sf https://thompsonfams.com/version

# Verify the correct run succeeded — --json exposes headSha and conclusion
gh run list --workflow=deploy-worker.yml --branch main --limit 1 --json headSha,conclusion,status
# expect: conclusion=="success", headSha matches the SHA you pushed
```

**Never ask LT to check the Cloudflare dashboard.** If `deploy-worker.yml` shows success and `curl -sf /version` exits 0, the worker is live — regardless of whether the "Workers Build" badge appears in the PR.

If the Cloudflare GitHub App badge is missing or stale, ignore it. It is a reliability issue with Cloudflare's external integration, not a deploy failure.

### Workflow Safety Rules
1. **Workflow YAML should orchestrate only.** Real logic (Python, bash) belongs in `.github/scripts/`. No embedded heredocs. Each script gets a header comment: purpose, calling workflow, env vars expected.
2. **New workflow files CANNOT review their own introduction** — they require manual lint plus one sacrificial test PR before becoming a required check.
3. **Codex bot comment updates use an HTML marker** (`<!-- codex-pr-review -->`) for deterministic matching.
4. **workflow-lint runs before all other PR checks.** codex-pr-review has `needs: lint-gate` — broken YAML fails fast without wasting an OpenAI API call.
5. **CI tool versions are pinned.** actionlint v1.7.7, shellcheck from ubuntu-latest. Deterministic CI.
6. **Local lint is conditional on changed files.** audit-source.sh only runs actionlint/py_compile when those files changed. CI runs unconditionally.

### Codex PR Audit Lane

When Codex is asked to audit PRs:
1. Prefer GitHub connector tools for posting PR comments/reviews.
2. Use `gh`/`git` for PR diff, PR metadata, and local grep as needed.
3. At the start of any review session, request reusable permission for the full audit lane — one batch, not per-command:
   - `gh pr view`
   - `gh pr diff`
   - `gh pr comment`
   - `gh api repos/blucsigma05/tbm-apps-script/pulls`
   - `git fetch origin`
4. Post findings directly to the PR thread via GitHub connector.
5. Return only a short summary in chat with links to the posted comments.

**Pass/fail standard (enforced by `codex-pr-review.yml`):**
- **PASS** requires: explicit `**Verdict:** PASS` + `**Files Reviewed:**` section listing files seen. No P1 violations.
- **FAIL** — explicit findings or `**Verdict:** FAIL`.
- **INCONCLUSIVE** — anything else: usage-limit hit, truncated diff, missing diff, no verdict, `**Files Reviewed:**` absent, rubber-stamp phrases detected. INCONCLUSIVE blocks merge, same as FAIL.
- "Looks good" / no explicit verdict / reviewer asks a question = INCONCLUSIVE. Not a pass.

### Branch Hygiene
1. **Sync before push.** Mandatory `git fetch origin main` and rebase before any push. The staleness gate in audit-source.sh enforces this.
2. **Branch from latest.** New branches must be created from `origin/main` after a fresh fetch.
3. **No merge if behind.** Rebase on current main, then rerun checks before requesting merge.
4. **No broad "take ours" on shared files.** During conflict resolution on workflow YAML, CLAUDE.md, audit-source.sh, or UI files, rebuild each conflicted file from intent. Inspect the final diff.
5. **Hot file lock.** When a PR touches `.github/workflows/**`, `.github/scripts/**`, `CLAUDE.md`, or `audit-source.sh`, only ONE such PR may be in flight. Others wait, then rebase.
6. **Pre-flight conflict check.** Run `git merge-tree origin/main HEAD` before opening a PR. Resolve conflicts locally.

### Merge Order
When multiple PRs touch the same files, they merge sequentially. After each merge, other PRs touching those files rebase on new main and re-run checks.

### Visual Regression
Playwright captures viewport screenshots at each route's real device viewport plus a 1920x1080 desktop check. Uploaded as artifacts on every PR.

## Alert Tiers (HYG-12)
All `sendPush_()` calls must use a named constant from `PUSHOVER_PRIORITY` in AlertEngine.gs. No bare integers.

| Constant | Value | Behavior | Use for |
|----------|-------|----------|---------|
| `DEPLOY_OK` | -2 | Silent | Successful deploys (CI PR comments confirm) |
| `HYGIENE_REPORT_LOW` | -1 | Quiet delivery | Weekly stale sweeps, diagnostics |
| `CHORE_APPROVAL` | 0 | Normal sound | Chore/ask/approval notifications |
| `BACKLOG_STALE` | 0 | Normal sound | Backlog age warnings |
| `CLAUDE_MD_BLOAT` | 0 | Normal sound | CLAUDE.md growth trigger (HYG-04) |
| `TILLER_STALE` | 1 | Vibrate (high) | Tiller freshness breach |
| `CLOSE_OVERDUE` | 1 | Vibrate (high) | Month-close gate day 6–20 (escalates to 2 on day 21+) |
| `SECRET_EXPIRING` | 1 | Vibrate (high) | Secrets audit |
| `SYSTEM_ERROR` | 1 | Vibrate (high) | GAS ErrorLog new entries |
| `PROD_DOWN` | 2 | Emergency + ack | Production outage |
| `DEPLOY_FAIL` | 2 | Emergency + ack | Deploy pipeline blocked |
| `GATE_BREACH` | 2 | Emergency + ack | Hard gate violation |

## GAS Triggers
Installed via `installAllOpsTriggersSafe()`. Health via `diagOpsTriggersSafe()`. Drift surfaced by `reconcileOpsTriggersSafe()` running daily. Spec lives in `OpsTriggers.js:OPS_TRIGGER_SPEC` — add a row there (+ create the handler) for any new recurring function.

---

## Context Management

- **Step 0 cleanup:** Before any refactor on a file >300 LOC, do a cleanup-only pass first (dead functions, unused variables, stale comments, debug logs). Commit separately. Then start real work. This prevents context compaction from firing mid-task.
- **2,000-line read cap:** File reads truncate silently at ~2,000 lines. DataEngine.gs is ~4,000 lines. Always read in chunks using offset/limit. Never assume a single read captured the full file. See Large Files list below.
- **Grep truncation:** Tool results >50K chars are silently truncated. Suspiciously few results (e.g., 3 refs for a function used across 12 files) = re-run with narrower scope. State when truncation is suspected.

### Large Files (always chunk-read)
| File | ~Lines | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| DataEngine.gs | ~4,000 | Read in 1,500-line chunks. TAB_MAP is near top. |
| KidsHub.html | ~3,000+ | Single-file multi-surface (Buggsy board, JJ board, Parent Dashboard) |
| ThePulse.html | ~2,500+ | Full financial dashboard |
| TheVein.html | ~2,500+ | LT command center |
| Code.gs | ~1,500+ | Router + all Safe wrappers. Grows with every new route. |
